                    Polygel nails are a newcomer to the beauty industry, with many people questioning what makes them so different to the previous two options. Polygel is essentially the lovechild of acrylic and gel, combining both their good qualities but leaving out all the bad stuff (if only you could do that with men, eh.)
                    <br>Polygel can be applied as an overlay on your natural nails, or as a nail enhancement. It is still cured under a UV light, but it is a lot lighter than both gel and acrylic nails. It also has a much lighter fragrance, which is great for people that like the look of acrylics but can’t stand the smell! In terms of removing Polygel nails, the polish is buffed off rather than soaked off. However, the remaining polish can be soaked after if needed. Polygel is available in a range of colours, but gel polish can also be applied over the top if you fancy something different.

                <p>Gel nails are a jelly-like sticky substance. After the gel being applied to the nails, they are cured under UV/LED light. Gel nails are made of polymer resins which is a complicated chemical compound.  If you want to have gel nails you have to follow three simple steps. Firstly a base coat then a nail polish and after that, the desired nail polish or design is applied on top of the nails. The difficult part of having these nails is the use of UV light. That is why having these nails are a bit expensive. But, the natural glossy look of these nails is worth the money. Moreover, these nails are safer to have as the chemicals are not harmful to the health. Though the use of UV light can be a concerning issue for your health. You have to go for these nails keeping both the pros and cons in mind.</p>
