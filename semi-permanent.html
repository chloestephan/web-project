                    Gel nails are different to acrylic nails as they are not an extension of your natural nails, instead they are a polish that can last for up to 2 weeks. Gel nail polish is applied similarly to that of a normal polish, but instead of leaving the polish to dry, it is cured under a UV light. The result is a glossy, chip free manicure! Gel nails don’t tend to damage your natural nails as much as acrylics, however they still do have some negative effects. Gel polish can be difficult to remove, and the process involves soaking your nails in acetone and buffing off the polish, which can make your nails weak and dry. We recommend that if you do like getting a regular gel mani, make sure to keep your hands and nails moisturised in between, to try and combat some of the effects.

                    <br>They only last for up to 2-3 weeks.
                    <br>Exposure to UV rays can be dangerous to skin.

                    <br>If badly applied, the gel can peel off.
                    <br>The removal process involves soaking in acetone.
